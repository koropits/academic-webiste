abstract: This article reviews recent economic findings on the causal effects of temperature on labor productivity. The impact of temperature shocks on micro-level worker and plant productivity is a core channel in explaining temperature effects on aggregate economic output at the  macro-level. Besides physiological effects revealed in scientific studies, economic studies also find negative effects of temperature on mental productivity, including cognition performance, learning, and consequential decisions. The effectiveness of adaptation is inconsistent in macro and micro findings. Adaptation is found to be almost futile at the regional scale, but indeed alleviates temperature damage in various micro-level contexts. We highlight the distributional effects of temperature, and early-life exposure to extreme temperatures causes long-standing effects in adulthood. We propose some limitations of existing studies and provide several key points for future work.
