abstract: The ESG investment philosophy embodies investors' pursuit of sustainable development and deeply reshapes the capital market landscape. However, there is still a lack of research that systematically examines how ESG investments impact the efficiency of China's capital market. This paper empirically investigates the impact of corporate ESG performance on stock mispricing and underlying mechanisms using data for Shanghai and Shenzhen A-share listed companies from 2017-2021. The result shows that the improvement in corporate ESG performance significantly corrects stock mispricing, but the effect is concentrated on corporates that stock price is overvalued and is not significant for corporates with the undervalued stock price. The instrumental variable (IV) estimation indicates that one standard deviation increase in ESG performance reduces the degree of mispricing by 13.19% and the probability of mispricing by 4.07%. The baseline findings are robust under a series of robustness checks. The mechanism analysis shows that corporate ESG performance raises the attention of both retail and institutional investors, and the reduction of information asymmetry due to information communication contributes to the correction of mispricing. In terms of ESG investment strategy, the popular "negative list screening" strategy in the A-share market hinders the mispricing correction of undervalued stocks, while the influence of the "ESG integration" strategy is not obvious. The asymmetric impact of corporate ESG performance on two types of mispriced stocks is jointly induced by the information communication effect and ESG investment strategies. This paper presents meaningful implications for corporates, investors, and financial regulators, and provides novel insights into the discussion of ESG investment philosophy and capital market efficiency in the new development era.
