abstract: This paper examines whether localities are strategic responses to the announced-to-be-regularized central environmental protection inspection (CEPI) by using high-frequency production-side electricity consumption data. We demonstrate that by conniving at overproduction before the arrival of the inspection and restricting production during the on-site inspection, the localities achieve the gain of avoiding economic losses and political non-compliance at the same time. Once the inspector leaves, production activities rebound immediately and even exceed the pre-inspection level. The response patterns provide by air quality data are relatively noisy and are one-week lags to production activities. Industry-level evidence implies that the in-advance overproduction is dominated by industrial sectors and is more pronounced in light industrial sectors within the secondary industry. Restrictions on production and rebounds effect are prevalent in all industries but differ in magnitude. The incentive and capacity of the local government to collude with enterprises are essential determinants of strategic response. There are weaker strategic responses when the party secretary or mayor is closer to retirement or has a higher likelihood of promotion. From the government-business relationship, the local government with a lower cleanliness level can strongly mobilize enterprises to adjust production systematically. While the cordial government dedicated to providing corruption-free business assistance is less authority in making enterprises comply with arrangements.
