abstract: This study uses survey data from 2,111 households in Shenyang City, a severely polluted city in China, to examine the role of community pharmacy density in narrowing the inequality of older-younger peopleâ€™s defenses against air pollution. To address endogeneity, we exploit the administrative approval data for new pharmacy openings during 2014-2016 as the instrumental variable for the stock of pharmacies in 2018. The 2SLS estimates indicate that richer pharmacy density increases the probability that residents wear the anti-smog mask on heavily polluted days, but the effect only appears in the elder over 65. The theoretical model reveals that the result can be led by the search cost effect and information effect, and both channels are supported by empirical findings.
