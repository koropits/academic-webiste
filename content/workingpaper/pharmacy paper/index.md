abstract: Exposure to fine particulate matter is associated with various health damages, and the negative effects are stronger in the elder compared to the younger, but limited literature has focused on measures that help to mitigate the air pollution exposure inequality. In this study, we investigate the causal effect of pharmacy richness around communities on the anti-smog-mask wearing of age-stratified residents in Shenyang City, a severely polluted city in China, in 2018. By constructing instrumental variables using administrative approval data for new pharmacy openings during 2014-16, 2SLS estimations indicate that higher pharmacy density promotes residents to take defensive behavior on heavily polluted days, but the effect only appears in the elder over 65. The theoretical model suggests that mechanisms can be decomposed as search cost effect and information effect, both supported by empirical findings.
