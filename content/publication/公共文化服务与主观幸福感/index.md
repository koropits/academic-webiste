abstract: This article discusses the relationship between the development of village public cultural services and the happiness of rural households. Life Satisfaction Approach （LSA） is proposed to evaluate the monetary value of village public cultural service. Based on the survey data of 638 rural households from 43 villages in 22 provinces in China，the research finds out that the development of village public cultural service has a significant positive impact on the happiness of rural households，and the enhancement of happiness caused by 1% growth of cultural service is equivalent to that caused by 0.614% growth of rural household annual income. This article argues that China should strengthen the construction of village public cultural services and hence improve the happiness of rural households.
