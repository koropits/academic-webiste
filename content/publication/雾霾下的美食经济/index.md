abstract: Bad air has influences on human socioeconomic activities from many aspects, but there’s a lack of literature on how it affects residents’ dining out behavior. This paper uses large-scale micro-dining data of a well-known chain restaurant in China in 2015, systematically analyzes the impact of air pollution on residents’ two-stage decisions. In the first stage, residents have to choose ‘dining out or not’, and in the second stage, the type of food and the amount of intake are decided. The results show that in the first stage air pollution significantly reduced the number of people dining out, which led to a loss of 356 million Yuan in offline catering income in Beijing, 2015. In the second stage, air pollution promoted residents’ food consumption and energy intake that compensated for 9.51% loss in the first stage. What’s more, we find that for different groups, the impacts of air pollution on their second stage decision are different, residents who consume more food and have higher energy intake are more affected by air pollution. This study suggests in assessing the economic cost of catering industry caused by air pollution, analysts should comprehensively consider the two-stage decisions of dining out. Ignoring the compensation effect of the second stage will overestimate the impact, and the relevant industrial policies based on the assessment result may be inefficient.
