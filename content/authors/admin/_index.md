I am now a Ph.D. candidate in economics at Tsinghua SEM, expected to graduate in 2024.

My research fields focus on environmental and development issues in China, using detailed micro-data to conduct econometric analysis. My recent research concentrates on understanding the socio-economic impacts of climate change and environmental pollution in China, and I am also exploring welfare gaps for heterogeneous groups under digitization.
